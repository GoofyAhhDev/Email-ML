# Email-ML

This project is for me to learn about Machine Learning and phishing email detection.

- Runs scripts to train and test a model
- Model files (`*.pkl`) are ignored (see `.gitignore`) due to Github size limitations
- If you want the trained model, ask me or train your own

Requirements:  
- Python 3  
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage:  
- Run `train_phishing.py` or `train_spam.py` to train, `classify_phishing_eml.py` or `classify_spam_eml.py` to test

Thatâ€™s it.
